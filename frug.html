                <h2>OUR COMMITMENT</h2>
                <p>We’ve built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good along the way. We want to make it easy
                    for you to discover and brew the world’s best coffee at home. It starts at the source. To know the
                    specific beans we source and purchase, we travel mostly to origin to truly understand the challenges
                    and limitations, and work side-by-side with farmers. Curating only the finest blend, we roast each
                    lot to highlight tasting profiles distinctive to their native growing region.</p>

                <h2>UNCOMPROMISING QUALITY</h2>
                <p>Although we work with growers who pay close attention to all stages of harvest and processing, we
                    uphold an extra quality check program to guarantee consistency in every cup. Our rigorous quality
                    control program is second to none and includes cupping each batch before it is roasted to a sweet
                    and clean cup. Our goal is to roast consistent, user-friendly coffee, so that brewing is easy and
                    enjoyable.</p>
